# Performance Workshop | Database vs In-Memory

This repository contains the source code for a hands-on workshop that was conducted to demonstrate the speed difference between accessing data from RAM (using Redis) and Disk (using Postgresql). 
The aim of this workshop was to provide interns with a practical understanding of how different data stores can impact application performance.

# Overview

During the workshop I have leaded to interns and we implemented a simple .NET Core Web API application which performs write and read operations using both Redis and Postgresql. This hands-on approach allowed participants to see first-hand the speed advantages of an in-memory database like Redis when compared to a disk-based relational database like Postgresql.
